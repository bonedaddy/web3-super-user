# Securing DNS

DNS can often be used to conduct powerful attacks, and also passive censoring. As such it is recommended that you utilize a secure DNS installation. For our purposes we will be running DNSCrypt, and enforcing the usage of all the latest DNS security features. Additionally this will allow for local caching of DNS requests, improving query performance.
