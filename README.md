# Deploying A Web3 Super User Server

This documentation is intended to serve as a resource for web3 super users who self host their infrastructure, however it also serves as a general guide for securing your operating system without having to significantly impact your workflow (ie: using QubeOS).

If you are not familiar with systems administration this guide is not for you.

# What Is Covered

* Docker hardening
* Kernel hardening
* Boot process hardening
* Network hardening
* Update hardening

And as a small bonus some system configurations are included  that should hopefully provide a performance boost.
